# Car_Detection_and_Localization_YOLO

Building a car detection system using Convolution Neural Net (Deep Learning). 
"You Only Look Once" (YOLO) algorithm pre trained model is used.
Used Intersection over Union to for final prediction and to eliminate over lapping prediction using Non-max suppression
